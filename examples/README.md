## [Hello MPI w/Slurm](./hello_mpi)
The most basic distributed python program we can write.

## [Dartboard Pi](./dartboard_pi)
Estimate the value of pie using RNG.

## [Poison MPI](./poisson)
Demonstrates a simple scatter operation using NGSolve's native ability to distribute a mesh and collect the result into a serialized python object.

Taken from [this example](https://docu.ngsolve.org/latest/i-tutorials/unit-5a.1-mpi/poisson_mpi.html) in the NGSolve documentation. (comments added by aujxn)

Also demonstrates how to interactively use a Jupyter notebook on the cluster.
